# Spline

This is the demo app that accompanied my [AVFoundation talk][ss] at the [Toronto Area Cocoa & Web Objects Developers Group][tacow] on May 14, 2013. It showcases capture, composition, a custom player and scrubber interface, synchronized CAAnimations, and real-time VFX. I hope you find it useful. Spline is a funny word.

## Requirements
Universal app. iOS 6 only.

## RGMRecordingViewController

This is a very simple implementation of the popular video app [Vine][v]. Tap the camera button to start a capture session. The gimmick: it only writes samples while your finger is on the screen. Tap the stop button to render the composition to disk.

## RGMPlayerViewController

Tap a video to view it in a custom player. This demonstrates use of `<AVAsynchronousKeyValueLoading>` to load track info, thumbnail generation, transport controls, periodic observation and looping. Hit the "Add Magic" button and drag your finger around the screen to record a CAKeyframeAnimation in synchrony with the current player item. Scrub the timeline to seek through the animation.

## RGMGLPlayerViewController

Tap the disclosure buttons (â€¦) to open a GLKView-based player. This uses the new `AVPlayerItemVideoDataOutput` class to collect and process sample buffers from a video file during playback on the GPU. Use the slider to change the intensity of a `CIColorMonochrome` filter *in real-time!*
